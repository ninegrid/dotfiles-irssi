Solarligned theme
---------------

Main attraction of this theme is consistent alignment of conversation metadata, such as nicknames, datetimes, etc.

There is no dark version for this theme. It is proposed to set up your work environment with light background for daytime and switch to inverse mode at night time or when needed. This has the advantage of applying to all applications, not just your IRC client. In a dark room, switching from a dark backgrounded IRC client into light backgrounded web browser is still quite hurtful to the eyes. It is also nearly impossible to find consistent looking light and dark themes to all applications one might use, therefore an operating system level solution should be heavily preferered.

 * OS X: press Ctrl+Option+Cmd+8
 * Linux: install [xcalib](http://xcalib.sourceforge.net), run `xcalib -invert`
